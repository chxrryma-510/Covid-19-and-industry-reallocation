								<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
								<p>The breakout of the covid-19 pandemic forced people to socially distancing and even being locked down by government intervention, this ultimately raised the demand for online shopping and the use of the internet. There was a surge of demand for certain products(Table.1), medical supplies, personal protection (e.g. masks, disposable gloves), the household necessities such as toilet paper and other groceries. (OECD, 2020)</p>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/table1.png" alt="" /></span>
									<blockquote>Table.1 The latest growing and declining categories in e-commerce from March 2019 to March 2019 (Stackline, 2020)</blockquote>
								
								<p>The outbreak of SARS coronavirus in 2002 and 2003 has shown that it produced considerable effect on e-commerce businesses. SARS is the core factor of transformation in internet services and retailing in China. For example, JD.com began selling products online after they saw the opportunity during the difficulty of the SARS outbreak. In 2004, JD.com closed its brick-and-mortar store and moved it online. (JD.com, Inc., n.d.) Same for Alibaba, Alibaba Group achieved positive cash inflow for the first time in 2002, and the business-to- consumer branch Taobao was first launched in 2003. ("Alibaba Group" 2021)</p>

								<p>The covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of e-commerce in the total retail, the retail sales through mail order or the internet in November 2020 increased by 14.6% compared to November 2020, which was the highest rise since 2006, as the annual growth rate not exceeded 5%. (Fig.1)</p>

                                    </blockquote>

                                <p>While dynamics vary across companies, the annual total revenue of the five most influential e-commerce businesses has been compared in the graph. (Fig.2) In general, the five companies both experienced an increasing trend during 2020, and it is clear that Amazon and Walmart have an increasing growth rate in 2020 in comparison with previous years.To ensure the e-commerce is successful and efficient, it is important to make users willing to shop online and stable digital connectivity is necessary. (Majcherczyk&Bai, 2019) In this case, the pandemic provides opportunities to the e-commerce industry, people are forced to shop online, which helps the growth of e-commerce businesses and enforces other industry growth toward the e-commerce and online transactions.</p>

								<p>Compared between Amazon and Alibaba, Amazon was affected by pandemic more than Alibaba if we don’t consider any other factors(e.g. the developing speed of e-commerce in two countries), although pandemic didn’t give adverse effects to both companies. Amazon’s revenue increased at an accelerating growth rate while Alibaba has a relatively stable speed of increase. The revenue growth rate of Amazon in 2020 is the highest among the 6 years, which achieved 37.6%. (Fig.3) On the other hand, from the net profit and revenue, Amazon

                                has relative more expenses during the epidemic than Alibaba; in this way, Alibaba earned more from the pandemic period. (Fig.4)</p>

                                </blockquote>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Alibaba.png" alt="" /></span>

                                <blockquote>Fig.4 Annual revenue and earnings of Amazon and Alibaba from 2017 to 2020 (Sources: Yahoo Finance)</blockquote>
								<p>For Amazon, consumer spending on it between May 2020 and July 2020 was up 60% from the same time in 2019. (Facteus, 2020) In addition, it accounts for a 38% market share of the e-commerce market that followed by Walmart, which only has 6% of the market share; the covid-19 help Amazon to boost the company’s dominance in the market. (Garcia, 2020) However, Amazon also benefits from selling the advertising, the advertising income in the first quarter of 2020 is $3.9 billion, up about 44% from a year earlier. (Semuels, 2020) These ads will appear on Amazon's website and products, such as Kindle and Amazon Prime TV. As e-commerce has been successful, online shoppers will be attracted by the website recommended goods that appear on the first page of the website or after they have searched for something. As a result, advertising on Amazon or such an online shopping website is essential for the sellers who sell on the site. </p>
								<p>For Alibaba, covid-19 accelerated the success of China’s shopping festival. In June 2020, Alibaba release the annual 6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival. Within the first 10 hours, total commodity trading volume increased by 50% from the previous year, and the gross merchandise value stood at $98.52 billion, which exceeded the total sales of the 2019 Singles Day Shopping Festival(the other major shopping events in China). (CNBC, 2020)

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/strategicpic.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>During the covid-19 pandemic, Alibaba daily focus on the retool, rebuild and recover their customers and partners. Firstly, it started the rural support program. Farmers can access Taobao live for free and also getting benefits from the economic resources from Alibaba. Taobao live announced they offer training for the framers in order to enlarge the transaction in rural areas and increase the agricultural sales. Secondly, Alibaba has helped other industries overcome the difficulties during pandemic through their live stream platform, and generate considerable income from it. As many tourist attractions and cultural heritages have been closed since the outbreak of coronavirus, Taobao Live launched an online tour that allows people can have a look at these views on their phones. In addition, Tmall(Alibaba's e-commerce platform) partnered with Shanghai Fashion Week to carry out the world’s first virtual fashion week. Opening showcase on the first day attracted 2.5 million views. By the end of the event, there are a total of 11 million views and helped generate more than $2.82 million. (Alizila, 2020) Other than that, Alibaba also cooperated with businesses and organizations all around the world and expand the areas that can be covered by e-commerce. In this case, more and more industries rely on Alibaba or even become one of its platforms during the pandemic, this leads to stronger market power of Alibaba. </p>
								<p>On the other hand, Amazon hasn't made so many changes compared with Alibaba. During online shopping at pandemic, Amazon has taken steps to ensure customers can get the household necessities and medical supplies faster. Amazon also increased order capacity for Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods Market. (Moorhead, 2020) Same of Alibaba, Amazon also launched a program that helps small and medium-sized enterprises to recover. However, one of the obvious reasons that Amazon can become the pandemic giant is it has the leading salary and comparative advantage. Even if the public has many disputes about Amazon's treatment of employees, employees are still working productively in the enterprise, mostly because they are afraid they will lose their job during the covid-19 crisis. Moreover, before the pandemic, Amazon was already a beast presence in the economy and its customers live, this leads to a stable customer base for Amazon. During the pandemic, many physical stores are facing bankruptcy, therefore, Amazon being the only choice for the public. As a result, this invariably accelerates its growth during the covid-19 crisis. It is worth mentioning that, Walmart has surpassed eBay in U.S. e-commerce for the first time in 2020. From then on it is concluded that the coronavirus is shifting people's online shopping to necessities. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
								
								<p>This research proposal has described and analyzed the how can covid-19 pandemic having an impact on industry structure and performances. The industries continue to survive in the market with the help of e-commerce, and e-commerce can benefit from it in order to gain more during the crisis of covid-19. Within the industry, the transactions shift from luxury goods and bulky goods to groceries and necessities, this helps the hypermarkets or grocery stores such as Walmart to gain more market status.</p>
								<p>The implications of the covid-19 may last for a long time, and the e-commerce in goods and services will need to continue to adapt to the new environment. Covid-19 has expanded the scope of e-commerce, there is rising demand for services delivered electronically, such as the media, e-payments, education, and health. In other words, the pandemic provides opportunities for the e-commerce industry to restructure and show its unlimited potential. </p>
								<p>However, it hasn’t considered the development dimension during the analysis. There are some communities and countries are still have limited access to the internet, because they are rural or have low income. This illustrates the problem that whether the sellers and customers in these areas have the opportunity to benefit from e-commerce. In this case, it is important for e-commerce businesses to ensure that it is truly inclusive and serves as an opportunity for development. </p>

								<p>As mentioned above, the growth of e-commerce in people's daily life during the covid-19 has accelerated the inequity between certain areas and countries. This deserves the attention of the government and the worldwide organization as the covid-19 pandemic highlighting the importance of electronic commerce and the importance of bridging the digital divide between the developed countries and the developing countries. However, through the development of the internet, it has been considered the internet should be provided as public good by the government. It can allow more people to access the internet at a relatively lower price and accelerate the growth of digital society. Nevertheless, the free-rider problem would exist, which cause controversy from the public.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, how to deal with retail stores after the pandemic has also attracted much attention. Suffice it to say the pandemic has compressed the anticipated decade's e-commerce growth to between 2 and 5 years, and the contraction of the retail industry will accelerate in the next decade. The retail owners will be challenged to re-create the innovative new urgency and new purpose. The repurposing of both buildings and out-lots could be the main factor to focus on, not only simply a place to showcase goods.</p>
